# Apple Music ‚Üí Discord Rich Presence

A macOS application that listens to Apple Music.app and updates the user's rich presence in
Discord.app running locally.

## Development Requirements

- **macOS** (tested on macOS 15.6+)
- **Zig compiler** (tested with 0.15.1) https://ziglang.org
- **Discord Social SDK** see below

Optional:
- **Xcode** (full version, not just Command Line Tools, only when you need to regenerate `Music.h`)

### Discord Social SDK (Required)

Download the Discord Social SDK 1.5 from:
https://discord.com/developers/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/social-sdk/downloads

Extract to `$HOME/src/discord_social_sdk` or specify a custom path during build.

**‚ö†Ô∏è The Discord Social SDK is required - the build will fail if not found.**

**üîê macOS Security Note**: On first run, macOS will show a security popup for
`libdiscord_partner_sdk.dylib`. You must manually allow it in **System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security
‚Üí Security ‚Üí libdiscord_partner_sdk.dylib "Allow Anyway"**.

## Building

### Discord Application Setup

Before building, you need to create a Discord application and get your Application ID:

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Create a new application
3. Copy the **Application ID** from the General Information page
4. Set the `DISCORD_APP_ID` environment variable:

```sh
export DISCORD_APP_ID=your_application_id_here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Required**: The `DISCORD_APP_ID` environment variable must be set at build time. The build will fail if not provided.

### Building the Application

```sh
# Set your Discord App ID (required)
export DISCORD_APP_ID=1234567890123456789

# Debug build with default location of Discord Social SDK of $HOME/src/discord_social_sdk
# and lib/debug for the dynamic lib.
DISCORD_APP_ID=your_app_id zig build

# Release build with default location of Discord Social SDK of $HOME/src/discord_social_sdk
# and lib/release for the dynamic lib.
DISCORD_APP_ID=your_app_id zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

# Build with custom Discord Social SDK location and lib/debug
DISCORD_APP_ID=your_app_id zig build -Ddiscord-social-sdk=/path/to/discord_social_sdk

# Build with custom Discord Social SDK location and lib/release
DISCORD_APP_ID=your_app_id zig build -Ddiscord-social-sdk=/path/to/discord_social_sdk -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

`Music.h` is generated based on the currently present `Apple Music.app`, so it's probably version specific.
If it's out of sync, you can regenerate it by running `zig build Music.h`.

```sh
# Generate Music.h header (requires full Xcode installation)
zig build Music.h
```

### Running the Application
```sh
# Run with default settings (must build first with DISCORD_APP_ID)
DISCORD_APP_ID=your_app_id zig build run

# Or run the built binary directly
./zig-out/bin/music-discord-presence

# Run with custom polling interval
./zig-out/bin/music-discord-presence --interval 1000

# Show help
./zig-out/bin/music-discord-presence --help
```

## Development

### Testing
```sh
# Run all tests (DISCORD_APP_ID still required for build)
DISCORD_APP_ID=1234567890123456789 zig build test-all

# Run specific test suites
DISCORD_APP_ID=1234567890123456789 zig build test-config
DISCORD_APP_ID=1234567890123456789 zig build test-music
DISCORD_APP_ID=1234567890123456789 zig build test-integration
```

### Project Structure
- `main.zig` - Main application with polling-based track detection
- `MusicScriptingBridge.{m,h}` - Objective-C bridge to Apple Music.app
- `Music.h` - Generated header from Apple Music.app
- `tests/` - Comprehensive test suite

## Configuration

### Command Line Options
- `--interval, -i <ms>` - Polling interval in milliseconds (default: 500ms, minimum: 100ms)
- `--help, -h` - Show help message

### Build Options
- `-Ddiscord-social-sdk=<path>` - Specify Discord Social SDK location
- `-Dtarget=<target>` - Cross-compilation target
- `-Doptimize=<mode>` - Optimization mode (Debug uses `lib/debug/`, Release modes use `lib/release/`)
  - `Debug` (default) - Uses Discord Social SDK debug library
  - `ReleaseFast` - Uses Discord Social SDK release library (recommended for distribution)
  - `ReleaseSafe` - Uses Discord Social SDK release library with safety checks
  - `ReleaseSmall` - Uses Discord Social SDK release library optimized for size

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Apple Music is not running"**
- Ensure Apple Music.app is launched and playing music

**"DISCORD_APP_ID environment variable must be set at compile time" (Build failure)**
- Set the `DISCORD_APP_ID` environment variable before building
- Get your Application ID from https://discord.com/developers/applications
- Example: `DISCORD_APP_ID=1234567890123456789 zig build`
- **Build will not proceed without DISCORD_APP_ID**

**"Discord Social SDK not found" (Build failure)**
- Download Discord Social SDK from Discord Developer Portal
- Extract to `$HOME/src/discord_social_sdk`
- Or specify custom path with `-Ddiscord-social-sdk=/path/to/social-sdk`
- **Build will not proceed without Discord Social SDK**

**Build errors with Music.h**
- Run `zig build Music.h` to regenerate the header
- Requires full Xcode installation (not just Command Line Tools)

**No track changes detected**
- Default polling interval is 500ms
- Try lower interval: `--interval 200`
- Ensure Apple Music.app is actively playing different tracks

**macOS Security popup for Discord Social SDK library**
- macOS will block unsigned libraries on first run
- Go to **System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Security**
- Find `libdiscord_partner_sdk.dylib` and click **"Allow Anyway"**
- Restart the application after allowing the library

## Architecture

This application uses **polling-based track detection** via Apple Music.app's ScriptingBridge API.
The notification-based approach was found to be non-functional on modern macOS versions and has been
deprecated.

**Data Flow:**
```
main.zig ‚Üí MusicScriptingBridge ‚Üí Apple Music ScriptingBridge ‚Üí Discord Social SDK
```
